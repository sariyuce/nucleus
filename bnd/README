- './binucleus <graph> <algorithm> <hierarchy?>" to run;
		 <graph> is the bipartite input graph in matrix market (.mtx or .txt suffix) [1], SNAP [2] (out. prefix) or Chaco [3] (.graph suffix) format. It can be a binary file as well (See [4]).
		 <algorithm> is LEFT_TIP, RIGHT_TIP or WING. LEFT or RIGHT indicates the position of vertices in the input file; for "45 51" edge in the input file, 45 is a left vertex and 51 is a right vertex.
		 <hierarchy> is YES or NO. YES computes the hierarchy, subgraphs, and densities. NO computes only K values.

- When <hierarchy> is YES, there are 2 output files
		- <graph>_<algorithm>_Hierarchy: Runtimes, statistics, and significantly dense subgraphs, i.e., subgraph is a leaf, its size on each side is larger or equal to LOWERBOUND (set to 0 in main.h), and its density is at least THRESHOLD value (set to 0.0 in main.h)
		- <graph>_<algorithm>_NUCLEI: Each line is a subgraph, first 8 numbers are: subgraph id, K value, |LeftV|, |RightV|, |E|, edge density, 1 (0) if the nucleus is (not) a leaf in the hierarchy, and parent subgraph id. Following numbers are vertices
		 (if algorithm is LEFT_TIP or RIGHT_TIP), or edges (if it is WING). Upper limits for *TIPs is 200 vertices (VERTEXUPPERBOUND in main.h) and for WING it's 3000 edges (EDGEUPPERBOUND in main.h)

- In a *_RIGHT_TIP_Hierarchy file, consider the following line;
"id: 7  K: 52  |PV|: 5  |SV|: 18  |E|: 52  ed: 0.58  LEAF?: 1  parent id: 6	5 6 7 8 9 -1"
It means the subgraph with id 7 has K value of 52, and it has 5 primary (right) vertices, 18 secondary (left) vertices, 52 edges with 0.58 edge density (52/(5*18)). The subgraph is a leaf in the hierarchy and its parent is the subgraph with the id of 6. Following five numbers are the vertex ids in the primary set.

- In a *_WING_Hierarchy file, consider the following line;
"id: 8  K: 11 |PV|: 4  |SV|: 5  |E|: 19  ed: 0.95  LEAF?: 0  parent id: 7       3 2  3 3  3 4  3 6  5 1  5 2  5 3  5 4  5 6  6 1  6 2  6 3  6 4  6 6  8 1  8 2  8 3  8 4  8 6  -1"
It means the subgraph with id 8 has K value of 11, and it has 4 primary (selected side is mentioned at the top of this *_WING_Hierarchy file) vertices, 5 secondary vertices, 19 edges with 0.95 edge density. The subgraph is a NOT leaf in the hierarchy and its parent is the subgraph with the id of 7. Following 19 pairs of numbers are the edges; first id is the primary vertex, second is the secondary vertex.

- Example: "./binucleus southern_woman.mtx WING YES" does wing decomposition and hierarchy construction
	
- To get the K values of vertices/edges, compile with 'K_VALUES=yes make'

- If you're NOT looking for the projection experiments, ignore the rest.

- 'EXPS=yes make' to compile for the projection experiments

- Example:	Running truss decomposition on left projection of the input bipartite graph southern_woman.mtx:
		- ./binucleus southern_woman.mtx BUILD_LEFT // constructs the weighted (and unweighted) projection 'southern_woman.mtx_BUILD_LEFT_W_projection.bin'
  		- ./binucleus southern_woman.mtx_BUILD_LEFT_W_projection.bin RUN_TRUSS YES // runs truss decomposition on the projection
  		- ./binucleus southern_woman.mtx MEASURE_TRUSS_LEFT southern_woman.mtx_BUILD_LEFT_W_projection.bin_RUN_CORE_NUCLEI // finds the bipartite subgraphs induced by the vertices in truss subgraphs and append each line in *NUCLEI file by the |PV|, |SV|, |E| and edge density. Truss subgraphs are define on left vertices here, and the bipartite subgraph induce on those vertices are computed in this step. 

- Example: Running weighted core decomposition on right projection of the input bipartite graph southern_woman.mtx:
		- ./binucleus southern_woman.mtx BUILD_RIGHT
  		- ./binucleus southern_woman.mtx_BUILD_RIGHT_W_projection.bin RUN_WEIGHTED_CORE YES
  		- ./binucleus southern_woman.mtx MEASURE_CORE_RIGHT southern_woman.mtx_BUILD_RIGHT_W_projection.bin_RUN_WEIGHTED_CORE_NUCLEI

Todos:
- fix VtxType and EdgeType to support lols
- support lols by making everything vertex or edge type
